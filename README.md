# (WIP) learncgo
Hand-crafted cgo examples


# RoadMap
- [x] 1.getting_started - basic knowledge of c/c++, such as how to link c/c++ with go, how to access struct/union/enum/class/pointer via go
- [x] 2.cpplib_exercise - a full example shows how to use go to access c++ libraries - [toml11](https://github.com/ToruNiina/toml11)
- [ ] 3.advance_cgo - basic knowledge of cgo advance usage - such as how C references to Go, how to use c/c++ function pointer via go(callback)
- [ ] 4.cgolib_exercise - a full example shows how to use c++ access go libraries - [docker/libtrust](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/tree/main/vendor/github.com/docker/libtrust)
- [ ] 5.final_practice - a full example shows how to use cpython to access go libraries through c++
